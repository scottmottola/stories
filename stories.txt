the long fix:
	When i started college, one of my first Computer Science classes was C++.  On one of the assignments i had finished all the code but whenever i attempted to run the program it brought up an error. I kept trying to fix the error but it would change but always go in loops never actually fixing the problem.  I eventually brought it to my teacher and she indicated that everything looked right to her.  She then typed up the an identical program and it worked so she passed the grade but i continued to try to fix my program.  after a month of working on this assignment i found near the top of my code i was missing a semicolon at the end of one of my lines.  I have learned to be thorough in my code and to test often.

scope:
	I have been working on a project for years.  It has taken so long because i have been following guides it accomplish different results.  It has been very difficult because all the systems in the project cause problems with one another.  I have restarted this project multiple times.From this experience I have been able to tell that it is better to have smaller scopes and have an orginized plan going into a project.  I have just been working on it still to see what else I can learn from it.
